# 🎼 Kidung Jemaat Digital — Numbered Notation Engine

*A MusicXML → Numbered Notation renderer with layout logic built from scratch.*

This project aims to digitize and render **Kidung Jemaat** hymns into numbered notation (not angka) based on the Indonesian Yamuger (yayasan musik gereja), following the visual style of the official publication as closely as possible.

The goal is to create a searchable, accessible, and accurate digital version of Kidung Jemaat, starting from **MusicXML** sources and manually curated metadata.

## ✨ Current Progress

### ✔ **Content Digitization**
* 110 / 478 hymns fully digitized
* Each hymn translated from MusicXML to custom numbered-notation format
* Metadata and layout rules preserved

### ✔ **Rendering Engine**
Currently the project exposes only the **core engine**, responsible for:

* Parsing MusicXML
* Mapping pitch → numbered notation
* Detecting ties, slurs, note lengths
* Rendering line layout
* Horizontal spacing rules
* Line-break logic
* Multi-verse alignment (first verse baseline complete)

The engine outputs SVG-based notation modeled after the original KJ print style.

## 🏁 Getting started
- Clone the repository
- Checkout [releases tab](https://github.com/jodi-ivan/numbered-notation-xml/releases)  
- Download these two files:  
    - **kidung-jemaat.db** : the metadata of the music that cannot be stored in the musicxml
    - **musicxml.zip** : musicxml files that needed for the app to run
- Place them somewhere in the drive
- Adjust config in the `files/etc/numbered-mutation-xml/config.ini`
- run the app from `cmd/rest/app.go`
- open browser and open `http//localhost:[port]/kidung-jemaat/render/1` (currently from 1 to 110)
> 💡 Alternatively you can download the `goldenfiles.zip` to see the final render looks like.

## 🧠 Why This Project Exists

I started digitizing Kidung Jemaat for personal use, to create a digital hymnal with clean notation and better searchability.
Along the way, it grew into a more general exploration of:

* music engraving algorithms
* layout engines
* type-setting rules for classical hymnbooks
* MusicXML parsing
* text-notation alignment

Development pauses occasionally when I research better automation approaches
